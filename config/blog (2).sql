(12, 'post', 'mostly my own, too‚ÄìMark Twain‚Äôs observation undoubtedly applies: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.‚Äù The principle holds across genres, in letters, reporting, and other writing. It‚Äôs harder to be concise than to blather. (Full disclosure, this blog post will clock in at a blather-esque 803 words.) Good writing is boiled down, not baked full of air like a souffl??.
